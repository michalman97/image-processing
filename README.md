# Remote sensing in sesame
Sesame, a crop with high nutritional value and great importance in the diet of many of the world's population, is currently grown in a traditional way by hand and is not economically efficient. 
As part of the research in which I am participanting in the laboratory of Professor Zvi Peleg at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 
with the help of genetic analysis and tools of remote sensing and image processing, we hope to improve the way we grow sesame and hopfully benefit the world.
